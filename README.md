Ancient Greek Temple Simulation

Overview
This project is a simulation of an ancient Greek temple rendered using OpenGL, featuring a Phong shading model and two light sources. The simulation aims to provide a realistic visualization of the temple's architecture, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow to enhance the visual experience.

Features
Realistic Temple Model: A detailed 3D model of an ancient Greek temple, including columns, pediments, and intricate architectural details.
Phong Shading: Implementation of the Phong shading model to achieve realistic lighting and material effects, including ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.
Lighting: Two light sources are used to create a dynamic lighting environment, allowing for realistic rendering of shadows and highlights.
Camera Controls: Interactive camera controls for navigating around the temple, providing different viewing angles and perspectives.
